\section*{Introduction}

Do you ever watch low-budget and no-budget films?  In the era of streaming television they're everywhere.  It is pretty easy to make and distribute your own film today.  Everybody can be their own King or Queen of Cult if they truly want to try.

So, let's try!  This can definitely be played solo.  You'll be playing multiple parts, though.

\section*{Determining Your Budget}

Wearing the "Financier" hat, you need to make some rolls to start off.  A budget cap has to be set.  You will need a normal set of polyhedral dice used for roleplaying games as well as additional six-sided dice.  The Financier will be rolling the D20, the D12, the D10, the D8, and the D4 at the start.

The Financier rolls each die once and writes the numbers down.  He then multiplies the numbers together.  That total is then multipled by one hundred.  That gives you the budget topline you just cannot exceed with your proposed film.  If it seems low, it likely is.  The dice are helping you craft a story as efficiently as possible.

Once you have your budget topline, you can then take off the "Financier" hat and move on to setting a few more parameters for your story.

\section*{The Tables of Wonders}

Cheesy low-budget/no-budget films generally stick to certain genres and tropes.  Rolling on the tables below lets you mix and match to come up with your own unique twist for a new film.  You will need to roll a D6 five separate times.

\section*{What Next?}

After you have a budget cap and rolled your premise, you need to start coming up with your story idea.  No story idea is too half-baked or off the wall.  Remember, your budget cap is way too low.  Whatever you want to do is going to have cut corners \emph{somewhere}.  Leverage that.

When you've got your story idea, read it aloud.  Think about the contours of it.  Is this something you'll see in major theaters?  Is this something you'll see in the dark corners of a streaming service?  Is this something you'll see on a sketchy website out of Central Asia?  Calibrate your story to where you think it would land.

At the end, celebrate your success.  Imagine how you would make such films.  If you're bold enough, take those sorts of ideas and processes to the next Film Race and see what you can do.  After all, we need more stories being told in our world.
