This is a submission to the [One Page RPG Jam 2025](https://itch.io/jam/one-page-rpg-jam-2025).  The title is a nod towards a cheesy movie known as *[Birdemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Birdemic:_Shock_and_Terror&oldid=1297554545)* that I am somehow a fan of it seems.  Eventually the infamous *[Bikini Hackers](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt21419538/)* may be referenced.  If you haven't seen these films you have many multiple ways of doing so.

The premise to the game is to have a few tables to get you started.  Make your own pitch for a low-budget to no-budget film.  The table votes on which is the best.  If there is a GM they'll be the financier.
